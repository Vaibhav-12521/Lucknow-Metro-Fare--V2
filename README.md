## 🧮 Fare Calculation Logic

The fare is determined based on the number of stations between the start and destination:

| Number of Stations | Fare (₹) |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| 1                  | ₹10      |
| 2                  | ₹15      |
| 3 - 6              | ₹20      |
| 7 - 9              | ₹30      |
| 10 - 13            | ₹40      |
| 14 - 17            | ₹50      |
| 18+                | ₹60      |

Travel time is estimated at **2 minutes per station**.
